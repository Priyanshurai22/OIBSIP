                <h3><u>The Beginning</u></h3>
                <p><span>Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale)</span>, (19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680) was an Indian ruler and a member of the <span>Bhonsle dynasty.</span>Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the <span>Sultanate of Bijapur</span> that formed the genesis of the<span> Maratha Confederacy.</span> Shivaji was born in the <span> hill-fort of, near Junnar, which is now in Pune district.</span> Scholars disagree on his date of birth; the Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).Shivaji was named after a local deity, the <span>Goddess Shivai Devi.</span><br><br>
                Shivaji belonged to a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan. Shivaji's father, <span>Shahaji Bhonsle,</span> was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates. His mother was <span>Jijabai,</span> the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan, and Indapur to provide for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for his family's residence.<br><br>
                At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three <span>Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar, Golkonda, and the Mughal Empire.</span> Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshahi of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.</p>

            <div class="rise">
                <h3><u>The Rise</u></h3>
                <p>In 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji captured the <span>Torna Fort</span> through stratagem or bribery, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur court due to the illness of <span>Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah,</span> and seized the large treasure he found there. In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including <span>Purandar, Kondhana, and Chakan.</span> He also brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati, and Indapur under his direct control. He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named <span>Rajgad.</span><br>
                They emerged as a power in the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century, they fought a series of wars against the Mughal Empire. The conflicts between these two groups were largely due to religious and cultural differences, as well as territorial disputes.<br><br>
                <span class="span_main">Combat with Afzal Khan:</span> Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Afzal Khan fought at the <span>Battle of Pratapgarh on November 10, 1659</span>. Shivaji killed Afzal Khan during a truce negotiation meeting at the fort. <br><br>
                <span class="span_main">Conflicts with the Mughals:</span> Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Mughal Empire were enemies who fought in many battles in the 17th century. Shivaji was a skilled military leader who used guerrilla warfare tactics to fight the Mughals.<br>
                <span class="span_main">Battles:</span><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Battle of Ahmednagar: In 1657, Shivaji raided Mughal territory near Ahmednagar, but was defeated by Nasiri Khan, sent by Aurangzeb</li>
                    <li>Battle of Pune: In 1659, Shivaji defeated a large force of Shaista Khan and the Bijapur army</li>
                    <li>Battle of Pratapgad: In 1659, Shivaji fought in this battle</li>
                    <li>Battle of Purandar: In 1665, Shivaji fought in this battle</li>
                    <li>Battle of Sinhagad: In 1670, Shivaji fought in this battle</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p><span class="span_main"> Guerrilla Warfare:</span><br>
                Shivaji used guerrilla warfare, which is a style of fighting that uses small groups<br>
                Shivaji prepared a small, agile Maratha army to fight in hilly areas<br>
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="rule">
                <h3><u>The Rule</u></h3>
                <p>
                Shivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he was still technically a <span>Mughal zamindar </span>or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule his de facto domain. The preparation for a proposed coronation began in <span>1673. </span>However, some controversies delayed the coronation by almost a year. One controversy erupted amongst the Brahmins of Shivaji's court: they refused to crown Shivaji as a king because that status was reserved for those of the kshatriya varna (warrior class) in Hindu society.<br>
                <span>On 6 June 1674, Shivaji was crowned king of the Maratha Empire (Hindavi Swaraj)</span> in a lavish ceremony at Raigad fort. In the Hindu calendar it was the 13th day (trayodashi) of the first fortnight of the month of Jyeshtha in the year 1596. <span>Shivaji was entitled Shakakarta ("founder of an era")and Chhatrapati ("Lord of the Umbrella").</span> He also took the title of <span>Haindava Dharmodhhaarak (protector of the Hindu faith) and Kshatriya Kulavantas: Kshatriya being the varna of Hinduism and kulavantas meaning the 'head of the kula, or clan'.</span><br><br>
                <span class="span_main">Conquest in Southern India:</span> Beginning in 1674, the Marathas undertook an aggressive campaign, raiding Khandesh (October), capturing Bijapuri Ponda (April 1675), Karwar (mid-year), and Kolhapur (July). In November, the Maratha navy skirmished with the Siddis of Janjira, but failed to dislodge them. Having recovered from an illness, and taking advantage of a civil war that had broken out between the Deccanis and the Afghans at Bijapur, <span>Shivaji raided Athani in April 1676.</span><br><br>
                
                <span class="span_main">Governance:</span> Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's governance was characterized by a decentralized structure, a fair land revenue system, and a focus on social justice.
                <ul></p>
                    <p><li>Decentralized structure- Shivaji's administration was made up of administrative divisions called prants. Each prant was led by a governor who was responsible for law and order, taxes, and local affairs. Shivaji's administration was built on the principle of empowering local authorities to address the needs of their regions.</li>
                    <li>Fair land revenue system- Shivaji implemented a land revenue system called "Ryotwari". Under this system, farmers were considered direct owners of their land and paid a fixed percentage of their produce as revenue.</li>
                    <li>Social Justice- Shivaji's governance was focused on the welfare of his people, especially those from the lowest classes. He relieved the poor from tax burdens when they were unable to pay.</li>
                    <li>Ashta Pradhan- Shivaji's administration was centered around the Ashta Pradhan, or Council of Eight Ministers. Each minister was responsible for a separate department, such as finance, military affairs, and justice. </li>
                    <li>Network of forts- Shivaji built a network of forts across his kingdom. These forts served as military strongholds, administrative centers, and symbols of Maratha sovereignty.</li>
